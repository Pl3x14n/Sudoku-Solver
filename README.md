Sudoku Solver
=============

This code package is the first release version of my sudoku solver. 
At the moment the 'humane' algorithm solves 49 out of 50 (easy) sudokus, and 319 out of 1011 (random) sudokus. The backtracking (and therefore the 'non-humane' algorithm) solves all sudokus you can think of (if it is unique!), with an average time of 80ms.
All files necessary for the solving algorithm can be found in the "Sudoku Classes" folder, while 
the main form as well as the default classes generated by VS can be found in the main directory.
My notification system can be found in the "Notification" folder.
As its known, the compiled binaries are uploaded as well, stored in the bin folder.
