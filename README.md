Sudoku Solver
=============

This code package is the first uploaded version of a sudoku solver.

All files necessary for the solving algorithm can be found in the "Sudoku Classes" folder, while 
the main form as well as the default classes generate by VS can be found in the main directory.
As its known, the compiled binaries are uploaded as well, stored in the bin folder.
